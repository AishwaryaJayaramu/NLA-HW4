# README

This repository contains my solution scripts for the various programmming exercises in Trefethen &amp; Bau's 'Numerical Linear Algebra'. The book is written for use with MATLAB, but I wanted to practice using the Numpy libraries so I did the equivalent in Python.  This is a work in progress and will be updated sporadically as I work through more chapters of the book.
