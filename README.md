# What?

My solution scripts for various exercises in Trefethen &amp; Bau's 'Numerical Linear Algebra'. 

# Why?

Although the book is written for use with MATLAB, I wanted to do the solutions using Python libraries. This is just an excuse to keep my linear algebra skills fresh and practice using python libraries.
